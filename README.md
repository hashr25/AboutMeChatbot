# About Me Chatbot

## Overview
The **About Me Chatbot** is an interactive chatbot application designed to answer questions about a specific individual. It utilizes OpenAI's Assistant API to provide tailored responses based on predefined training data. The application is separated into two distinct projects: a **Node.js backend** and an **Angular frontend**, both working together seamlessly using the `concurrently` package.

## Use Case
The chatbot allows users to:
- Query personal details and information about an individual.
- Receive natural language responses based on preloaded training data.
- Enjoy an intuitive and visually appealing faux-terminal interface.

This application is perfect for personal branding or showcasing detailed information about an individual in an interactive format.

## Features
- **Faux-Terminal UI**: A clean and minimal terminal-style user interface.
- **Dynamic Chat Responses**: The AI responds to user inputs dynamically.
- **OpenAI Assistant API Integration**: Utilizes a custom-trained OpenAI assistant.
- **Loading Indicator**: Provides visual feedback while waiting for AI responses.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Cleanly separates frontend and backend logic.

## Architecture
The application is divided into two main projects:

### **1. Node.js Backend**
- **Purpose**: Handles API requests, interacts with OpenAI's Assistant API, and serves as the backend for the chatbot.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Manages threads for ongoing AI conversations.
  - Sends user messages to OpenAI's Assistant API.
  - Retrieves and streams AI responses back to the frontend.

### **2. Angular Frontend**
- **Purpose**: Provides the faux-terminal user interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Displays messages from the AI in a chat-like format.
  - Allows users to input their queries.
  - Shows a loading animation while waiting for AI responses.

### **Integration**
Both projects run concurrently using the `concurrently` package:
- The backend runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
- The frontend runs on `http://localhost:4200`.
- A proxy is configured in the Angular frontend to forward `/api` requests to the Node.js backend, ensuring seamless communication between the two.

---

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**:
   - When the application loads, the backend creates a new thread using OpenAI's Assistant API.
   - The frontend displays an introductory message from the AI.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Users enter queries in the faux-terminal interface.
   - The frontend sends the user input to the backend via a `/api/assistants/message` endpoint.

3. **Backend Processing**:
   - The backend sends the message to OpenAI's Assistant API.
   - A response is generated by the Assistant API using the predefined training data.
   - The backend streams the response back to the frontend.

4. **Response Display**:
   - The frontend receives the AI response and displays it in the terminal UI.
   - A loading animation is shown while waiting for the AI's response.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16+)
- **Angular CLI** (v15+)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **OpenAI Assistant With Relevant Training**

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/about-me-chatbot.git
   cd about-me-chatbot
2. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to backend and install dependencies
    cd server
    npm install

    # Navigate to frontend and install dependencies
    cd ../client
    npm install
3. Add your environment variables:
- Create a .env file in the server directory with the following content: 
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id

### Running the Application
1. Start both backend and frontend concurrently:
    ```bash
    npm run start
This will:
- Start the backend on `http://localhost:3000`
- Start the frontend on `http://localhost:4200`
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
    
    `http://localhost:4200`
